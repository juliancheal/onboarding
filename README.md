# How to start contributing to the Tessel Project
Welcome, new [Team Member](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM-MEMBERS.md)! We're excited to have you. Please go through the steps below to familiarize yourself with the project.

If anything is confusing or out of date, please make it easier for the next person! Report issues and make PRs on this and all other Tessel repos.

###1. Sign the the [CLA](http://dojofoundation.org/about/claForm).
The Tessel Project is an open source project and a proud member of the Dojo Foundation. The Dojo Foundation requires that all contributors take 2 minutes to sign their Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before having any contributions accepted. Please do so [here](http://dojofoundation.org/about/claForm) before opening any Pull Requests on Tessel repos.

###2. Your first PR
Your next step is to officially add yourself as a Team Member. You can do so by opening up a Pull Request on the [tessel/project repo's  Team page](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md). Check out [this PR as an example](https://github.com/tessel/project/pull/63).

###3. Get started with your Tessel 2
Go to the [Tessel 2 start page](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/) and try it out! This should get you set up with using the CLI, connecting to Wifi, and using modules.

###4. Get to know T2's tech stack and repos
You'll be much more equipped to make meaningful contributions if you read the [Tessel 2 Technical Guide](https://github.com/tessel/onboarding/blob/master/T2-TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md). This guide goes over the main repositories, where you can find relevant code and design files, and how the Tessel 2 system architecture works.

###5. Get to know your mentor
Once you're part of the team and you have a high level understanding of how Tessel 2 works, get in touch with the person that introduced you to the project and set up a time to chat. This informal call will help you understand the current state of the project, where your help is needed most, and how you can get started. If you're not sure who to contact, get in touch with the person who accepted [your first PR](#2-get-started-with-your-tessel-2) or [jump on Slack and let us know you're ready to get started](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/).

###6. Get to know the team
Our primary communication channel is [Slack](https://tessel-slack.herokuapp.com/). We recommend keeping it open while you're working on Tessel; it's very useful for asking quick questions. Important channels:

* #engineering for most of your technical questions
* #team-members for discussion with your fellow Team Members
* #events-speaking if you're interested in giving conference talks

###7. Do something!
Your mentor can help you find something to work on, or the [T2 Completeness Checklist](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/70) is a good place to start. Pick something, ask questions, and get started!
